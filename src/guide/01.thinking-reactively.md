Understanding streams

In this first part of the book, you’ll get your feet wet with streams by discover- ing the stream as the missing data contemporary to the iterable.

Chapter 1 lays out the problem with the state of asynchrony in JavaScript and where other solutions don’t quite reach your ideal. In chapter 2, you’ll get an introduction to functional programming as the foundation for reactive program- ming. Here, you’ll walk through the basic parts of producing and consuming a stream. (If you’re already on board with streaming, you may wish to skim or skip these first two chapters.) In chapter 3, you’ll start to see some real RxJS usage as you explore your first operators and how you use them to create fluent streaming applications. Finally, in chapter 4, you’ll start looking at some more-complex operators and introduce a new dimension of streams: time. With this new dimen- sion, you’ll see the real power of using Rx for your asynchronous data.
